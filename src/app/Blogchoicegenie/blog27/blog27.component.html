            <h2>Hack # 3: Make Room for Cooling</h2>
            <p>Did you know that there is a mechanism drawing air into your fridge and freezer?</p>
            <p>Yes, and which ends with a vent serving as an outlet for the drawn air.</p>
            <p>Avoid putting the food right in front of that vent. You will be doing nothing but choking the fridge.
            </p>

            <h2>Hack # 4: Bring On the Task Lighting</h2>
            <p>It will be helpful to start using localized lighting when you work on the computer.</p>
            <p>You need only a particular space to be lighted. When your electronic gadgets are probably already powered up,
              you don’t need to consume more energy than is necessary.

            <h2>Hack # 5: Consecutively Clean the Laundry</h2>
            <p>Do try to do a few loads of laundry at a time. Take advantage of the warm dryer.
            </p>
            <p>Instead of having the dryer go from cold to warm, you should use it when it’s already warm. Your clothes will
              dry faster as the dryer does not have to run as long. </p>



              <h2>Hack # 6: Home Office: Unplugged!</h2>
              <p>If you are working from home, you most probably have a home office.
              </p>
              <p>Although it does not mean your home office has to do everything that normal business office does.
                  ChoiceGenie recommends to try not to plug every machine on at all times.
                  
                  When the printer has to be used once every 2 days, then avoid plugging it on 24/7. </p>
